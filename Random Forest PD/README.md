# Predicting Diabetes (Random Forest)

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify incoming patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on their symptoms. The data used for training the model is sourced from the the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is found here: [Early stage diabetes risk prediction dataset. - UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/529/early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset).

## Data

The dataset used for this project consists of data collected from a questionnaire given collected from a questionnaire given to patients in Sylhet, Bangladesh at the Sylhet Diabetes Hospital. All questions were binary yes/no questions about symptoms or final diagnosis classification.

## Model

The model for diabetes diagnosis is implemented in the Predicting Diabetes.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, training a Random Forest (RF) classifier, evaluating the model's performance, and feature importance.

## Results

The accuracy of the model for predicting diabetes on the testing set was between 98.7 and 99.4%.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

## Usage

1. Download the email dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/529/early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset) website and place it in the main folder.
2. Open the Predicting Diabetes.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. Once the model is trained, you can use it to classify patients as diabetic or non-diabetic based on symptoms.
