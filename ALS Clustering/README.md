# Assessing ALS Disease Progression (Cluster Analysis)

This project focuses on using clustering to chart disease progression based on their symptoms. The data used for training the model is sourced from the the PRO-ACT and is found here: [ALSFRS(R). - PRO-ACT](https://ncri1.partners.org/ProACT/Data/Index/1).

## Data

The dataset used for this project consists of data collected from data retrieved from the PRO-ACT site from ALS clinical trials.

## Model

The model for assessing disease progression is implemented in the ALS Clustering.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, feature selection, training a K-Means analysis, evaluating the model's performance, and analysis of each cluster.

## Results

A three cluster model shows the early and late stages of disease progression while also having a third cluster for the initial differences of disease progression (more bulbar symptoms) for women suffering from the disease.

## Requirements

To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

## Usage

1. Download the email dataset using the above link and place it in the main folder.
2. Open the ALS Clustering.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
